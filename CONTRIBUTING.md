## Welcome

:+1::tada: First off, I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to test and help us improve the QGIS Plugin! :tada::+1:
We welcome and encourage contributors of all skill levels and we are committed to making sure your participation in is inclusive, enjoyable and rewarding.

There are different ways to contribute to the QGIS Templates and Symbology Plugin

## Testing

We currently strongly encourage people to test the plugin as it is just being developed. In order to test it, please follow the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/hotosm/qgis-templates-and-symbology-plugin#readme) file : install the plugin, play with it and let us know if anything is not working as expected, or if you have suggestions for improvements by raising an Issue on Github. We will review and get back to you!

## Report bugs and suggest improvements

The [issue queue](https://github.com/hotosm/qgis-templates-and-symbology-plugin/issues) is the best way to get started. There are issue templates for BUGs and FEATURES that you can use, or you can create your own. 
## Code contributions

Create pull requests (PRs) for changes that you think are needed. We would really appreciate your help! 

## Translating
The Plugin is currently only available in English and would like to translate it into multiple language. If you are interested in helping us with language translations, please add an Issue stating "Translation" and the language you are interested in supporting us with.

## Thank you!
